# civstation

## Overview
A simple library that provides a Station object, which represents a Station of the kind found in civil plans of roads and other linear features, where 5+10 for example represents a point 510 feet (or meters or any units) from an arbitrary starting point.

## Station objects
Import the Station class:
```python
from civstation import Station
```
Create a station object:
```python
sta = Station("4+56.78")
```

Stations can also be made from a number, which will convert it to a Station.
```python
>>>sta = Station(456.78)
>>>print (sta)
4+56.78
```

Stations default to displaying two decimal places with trailing zeros. This can be changed by setting decimal_places to the desired number.

```python
>>>sta = Station(456.78, decimal_places = 4)
>>>print(sta)
4+56.7800
```


## Operations
Stations can be added, subtracted, and compared. 

Adding a station and a number (float, int, etc.) returns a Station. 

Subtracting a number from a station returns a Station.

Subtracting a a Station from a Station returns a **float**. This is because stations represent a position along a line. Subtracting two stations produces a *distance* not a *position*, best represented as a float, not a Station. However, this behavior can be overridden by setting `return_float_on_sub = False`, to work completely in Stations.

There doesn't appear to be a good reason to multiply or divide Stations, so it is not supported. If this is necessary, convert them to floats or another suitable type.  

## Defnition of Station object
The following code shows the args taken be a Station object.
```python
class Station:
    def __init__(self, sta, decimal_places = 2, return_float_on_sub = True) -> None:
```
